Installing
-----------
Download the latest release and extract into your `Includes` directory. Make sure to rename the folder to `SRL`.
The master branch is the development branch which can also be installed if you know what you're doing. 

Contributing
-------------
Some basic guidelines if you feel like contributing to this project:

- Keep up the current programming style.
- Readability is important.  
- Get familiar with our versioning: https://github.com/SRL/SRL/blob/master/VERSIONING.md
- No need for many ways to do the same thing.
- Fast code is nice, but if it notably reduces readability it's probably not worth it.
- Test your code, make sure it really works. If it has limitations tell us about 'em.
- The include is not supposed to do all the work.
- All contributions are appreciated, accepted or not.
- Plugins/Libaries: SRL should work Windows & Linux (both 32 and 64bit), so plugins has to be 
  made for those if you want it to be used by SRL.


Reach us
---------
